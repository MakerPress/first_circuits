== Squishy Circuits

Squishy Circuits was developed by Dr. AnnMarie Thomas and undergrad Samuel Johnson at the University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis.   It provides a fun way to encourage students to create and play with simple circuits.  

=== Project Instructions

The basic instructions cover making the play dough and then a number of different experiments that can be done with various components.

=== Kit

A kit is not necessary for this project but the electronics parts are easier to use.

=== Materials Preparation 

. Make the play dough in advance.   Students can make the play dough but it is usually a separate session. 
. Store the play dough in zipper bags or airtight canisters in refrigerator to slow mold growth.
. A stove or hot plate is necessary to cook the dough.
. This project uses battery packs.  A basic battery pack has red and black wires, which can be buried into the play dough.   The kits has its own connectors.   

=== Facilitation Tips

. Students can work in pairs or small groups and share battery packs.
. Students can start by using the conductive play dough and connecting a battery pack and lighting an LED.  See if they understand why the LED will light or not.   
. Some students may experiment touching the two pieces of play dough together to break or interrupt the connection.   
. Most students will be interested in seeing how many LEDs can be lit at once.  
. Encourage students to make different shapes, incorporating the insulating play dough.   You can show them some examples from the Squishy Circuits website to stimulate their thinking.  
. Allow time for clean-up.

=== Performance or Exhibition

. Take photos of the student creations.
