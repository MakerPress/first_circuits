== Squishy Circuits

Squishy Circuits was developed by Dr. AnnMarie Thomas and undergrad Samuel Johnson at the University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis.   It provides a fun way to encourage students to create and play with simple circuits.  

=== Project Instructions

The basic instructions cover making the play dough and then a number of different experiments that can be done with various components.

Kit
A kit is not necessary for this project but the electronics parts are easier to use.

Materials Preparation 
1. Make the play dough in advance.   Students can make the play dough but it is usually a separate session. 
2. Store the play dough in zipper bags or airtight canisters in refrigerator to slow mold growth.
3. A stove or hot plate is necessary to cook the dough.
4. This project uses battery packs.  A basic battery pack has red and black wires, which can be buried into the play dough.   The kits has its own connectors.   
Facilitation Tips
1. Students can work in pairs or small groups and share battery packs.
2. Students can start by using the conductive play dough and connecting a battery pack and lighting an LED.  See if they understand why the LED will light or not.   
3. Some students may experiment touching the two pieces of play dough together to break or interrupt the connection.   
4. Most students will be interested in seeing how many LEDs can be lit at once.  
5. Encourage students to make different shapes, incorporating the insulating play dough.   You can show them some examples from the Squishy Circuits website to stimulate their thinking.  
6. Allow time for clean-up.
Performance or Exhibition
1. Take photos of the student creations. 
LED Pop-Up Card
This project combines paper crafts and circuits, including creative and technical elements by using a battery and conductive tape to light an LED.  



Project Instructions
There are really two parts to this project.   One is creating the pop-up card from construction paper.   The second is using conductive tape to connect an LED to the battery.
