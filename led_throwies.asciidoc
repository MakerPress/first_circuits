LED Throwies consist of a coin cell battery and an LED, which make a simple circuit.  Adding a magnet and taping the bundle together gives you a small light that sticks to metal surfaces. The project was developed originally by James Powderly and Graffiti Research Labs in 2006 as an urban art/graffiti form.   It became instantly popular when published on Instructables.   LED Throwies appeared in Make: 06.
